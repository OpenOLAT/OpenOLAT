## Developers

### Setting up OpenOlat in Eclipse and PostgreSQL

This is an installation guide for developers.

#### Preconditions
* Check that you are using maven 3.8 or higher (mvn -V)
* Check that you have the git plugin installed in eclipse
* Check that you have git installed
* Check that you have Java 11 installed
* Check that you have Tomcat 9.0 installed

#### 1. In Eclipse

1. Clone OpenOlat:  
Create a repository location (`https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT.git`) and
clone the repository. Right click to clone the repository into your workspace.

2. Import OpenOlat as an Eclipse project:  
In Eclipse, use `Import -> Git -> Projects from Git (with smart import)` and import 
the local OpenOlat clone created in the previous step.

3. Disable validators:
   - Right-click on the project and open the project properties. Then search for `Validation`. Enable the project specific settings and disable all XML, XSLT, HTML and JPA validators. 
   - Right-click on the project and select `Validate`.

4. Create the OpenOlat configuration:  
Copy the `olat.local.properties.sample` in the project root folder to `src/main/java/olat.local.properties`, adjust
the file to match your setup. See the comments in the file header for more configuration options. 

5. Refresh the project

6. Setup the dependencies and compile
   - When running the first time, right-click the project and select `Maven -> Select Maven Profiles...`. Make sure `tomcat` and  `postgresqlunittests` are selected.
   - Right-click on the project and run `Maven -> Update Project`. 
   - Make sure the project compiled without errors. Warnings are ok. If the project did not compile, you have to fix the problems before you proceed. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.
      
#### 2. Setting up the PostgreSQL database

Create user `openolat` and a database `openolat`

```sql
CREATE USER openolat WITH PASSWORD 'openolat';
CREATE DATABASE openolat;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on DATABASE openolat to openolat;
```

Write the OpenOlat database schema to the OpenOlat database:

```sql
\c openolat openolat;
\i src/main/resources/database/postgresql/setupDatabase.sql
```

_Optional:_ if you want to run the jUnit tests, make sure you also create and initialize the
test database that you configured in `src/test/profile/postgresql/olat.local.properties`.


#### 3. Setting up the Tomcat server in Eclipse

Setup a tomcat server by clicking on `OpenOlat -> Run As -> "Run on Server"`. The
"Run on Server" wizard will pop up and you define define a new server. Look for
`Apache -> Tomcat v9.0`.

Add openolat as web application in the step "Add and remove" and click finish.

Double click the newly created server and increase the timeout to something like 180s.

Open the generated `server.xml` file and manually set the following parameters:

- In the `Context` element set parameter `reloadable="false"` 

You can now start the server and open the following URL
[http://localhost:8080/olat](http://localhost:8080/olat) in your favorite browser. You can
log in with user `administrator` and password `openolat`.
   
Have fun, give feedback and contribute!


##### Option: use application server database connection pool

By default and for your convenience the embedded connection pool is used, you don't need to configure anything. This is fine for simple development setups, but not recommended for production. To be as close as possible to a productive environment it is useful to use the application server connection pool also in the development environment: 

###### First: add the following properties to the `olat.local.properties` file: 

```
db.source=jndi
db.jndi=java:comp/env/jdbc/OpenOLATDS
```

###### Second: add the resource descriptor to your tomcat context descriptor:

```xml
<Resource auth="Container" driverClassName="org.postgresql.Driver" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
          maxIdle="4" maxTotal="16" maxWaitMillis="-1"
          name="jdbc/OpenOLATPostgresDS"
          username="postgres" password="postgres"
          url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/olat"
          testOnBorrow="true" testOnReturn="false"
          validationQuery="SELECT 1" validationQueryTimeout="-1"/>
```


### Alternate databases

#### MySQL 
Note that MySQL is still supported but not recommended and support might 
eventually come to an end. Use Postgres if you can. 

##### Prerequisites
* MySQL 5.6 or greater

##### Database setup
Create user `openolat` and a database `openolat`

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS openolat;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON openolat.* TO 'openolat' IDENTIFIED BY 'openolat';
UPDATE mysql.user SET HOST='localhost' WHERE USER='openolat' AND HOST='%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

The time zone needs to be set if you don't already defined it.

```sql
SET GLOBAL time_zone = 'Europe/Zurich';
```
 
Write the OpenOlat database schema to the OpenOlat database. Example for MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u openolat -p openolat < src/main/resources/database/mysql/setupDatabase.sql
```

##### Tomcat Setup

Open the generated server.xml file and manually set the following parameters:

- In all `Connector` elements set parameter `URIEncoding="UTF-8"`

##### Option: application server connection pool

```xml
<Resource auth="Container" driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
          maxIdle="4" maxTotal="16" maxWaitMillis="10000"
          name="jdbc/OpenOLATDS"
          password="olat" username="olat"
          url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openolat?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8&amp;cachePrepStmts=true&amp;cacheCallableStmts=true&amp;autoReconnectForPools=true"
          testOnBorrow="true" testOnReturn="false"
          validationQuery="SELECT 1" validationQueryTimeout="-1"/>
```

#### Oracle

Oracle support is experimental. The database schema is available and 
updated for historic reason, however running OpenOlat with Oracle is 
largely untested. Do not use it for production before you tested the 
entire application. We are interested in adding Oracle to our list of
fully supported and recommended database, contact us if you want to 
sponsor this compatibility. 


### Troubleshooting

* OutOfMemoryException: in Eclipse: setup VM arguments by clicking on Run > Run Configurations > Arguments > VM Arguments
  and pasting: `-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -Xms256m -Xmx1024m -Djava.awt.headless=true`

* Optional: create an empty olat.local.properties and save it to `/yourTomcatDir/lib`
  (OpenOlat searches for this file on the classpath and `/tomcat/lib` is part of it). But it
  should start with just the default config!

* Usually you will get a timeout exception when you start a new OpenOlat. After double clicking
  on the server entry you can increase the timeout for the startup.

* If your tomcat starts very quickly but you cannot access OpenOlat it might be that tomcat did
  not find the OpenOlat context. Right click the server entry and click publish to inform eclipse
  about a new or updated context.

* If you run into problems with classes or resources not found e.g. `ClassNotFoundException` right click your 
  server config and run the "Clean..." Task to republish all resources. Problems comes mostly when switching 
  from eclipse to console and back with command like mvn clean, or eclipse clean and such. You will always get 
  a clean and working environment when you do the following: Eclipse clean, create eclipse settings with launch, 
  Server publish resources and restart OpenOlat.
 
#### Eclipse Plugins
For a lean and speedy development setup it is recommended to to use a bare-bone Eclipse installation and only install
the following plugins:

- Data Tools Plattform SQL Development Tools
- Eclipse Java Development Tools
- Eclipse Java EE Developer Tools
- Eclipse Plattform
- Eclipse Web JavaScript Developer Tools
- Git integration for Eclipse
- Javadocs Help Feature
- JavaScript Developement Tools
- JST Server Adapters Extension for Eclipse
- M2E - Maven integration for Eclipse
- m2e-wtp - Maven integration for WTP
- Mylyn WikiText


### Background (optional for further interest)

There is only one spring context for the whole OpenOlat which you can access via
CoreSpringFactory. The context is configured with the files `serviceconfig/olat.properies`
and can be overwritten with `olat.local.properties`. Changes in olat.local.properties are
reflected upon each restart of Tomcat. You can further override OpenOlat settings with
JVM arguments `-Dmy.option=enabled`.

### Compress JavaScript and CSS

The JavaScript and CSS files are minified and aggregated. If you make some changes, run the following
command to compress them (execution time about 1-2 minutes) and refresh your Eclipse project:

```bash
mvn clean package
mvn compile -Pcompressjs,tomcat
```

### Themes

[Readme](src/main/webapp/static/themes/themes.README)

### REST API 

To read the OpenOlat REST API documentation:
1. start OpenOlat
2. go to Administration -> Core configuration -> REST API
3. Make sure the REST API is enabled
4. Click the documentation link in the admin panel

### Automated tests

#### Preconditions

* Make sure the following ports are not in use (Selenium, Tomcat )
  `14444 / 8080 / 8009 / 8089`

* Make sure you have PostgreSQL 9.4 or newer. The server must be at localhost. For other databases see [Alternative databases](#alternate-databases)

* Make sure maven has enough memory. E.g execute the following:

```bash
export MAVEN_OPTS= -Xms512m -Xmx1024m
mvn compile -Pdocumentation,tomcat
```

* Make sure the tmp directory is writable. E.g. execute the following.

```bash
ls -la `printenv TMPDIR`
```

#### Setup (necessary only once)

Setup database users and tables in the pom.xml. The default settings for PostgreSQL are:

```xml
<test.env.db.name>olattest</test.env.db.name>
<test.env.db.postgresql.user>postgres</test.env.db.postgresql.user>
<test.env.db.postgresql.pass>postgres</test.env.db.postgresql.pass>
```

You can override them with -D in the command line.

You need an empty database named `olattest`. The maven command will create and drop
databases automatically but need an existing database to do that. Here we will
explain it with PostgreSQL.


Create user `postgres` and a database `olattest`

```sql
CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';
CREATE DATABASE olattest;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on DATABASE olattest to postgres;
```

Write the OpenOlat database schema to the test database:

```sql
\c olattest postgres;
\i src/main/resources/database/postgresql/setupDatabase.sql
```

When using MySQL or Oracle make sure you are using the right db user as configured in 
the pom.xml or override them in the test properties file. 


#### Execute JUnit tests in Eclipse

Open the class `org.olat.test.AllTestsJunit4org.olat.test.AllTestsJunit4`. 

Righ-click on the class `Run as -> Run configuration`. Add your database configuration as VM parameters, e.g. 

```sql
-Ddb.name=olattest
-Ddb.user=postgres
-Ddb.pass=postgres
```
Run the tests


#### Execute JUnit tests on the command line

The JUnit tests load the framework to execute (execution time ca. 10m)

**For PostgreSQL**

```bash
mvn clean test -Dwith-postgresql -Ptomcat
```

with the options (only required if you don't use the standard settigns from above):

```bash
-Dtest.env.db.postgresql.user=postgres
-Dtest.env.db.postgresql.pass=serial
```

To only run the OpenOlat test suite and exclude the unit tests of QtiWorks, add the following
option:

```bash
-Dtest=org.olat.test.AllTestsJunit4
```

Example:

```bash
mvn clean test -Dwith-postgresql -Dtest.env.db.postgresql.pass=serial -Dtest=org.olat.test.AllTestsJunit4 -Ptomcat
```


**For MySQL**

```bash
mvn clean test -Dwith-mysql -Ptomcat
```

The following options are available to configure the database connection:

```bash  
-Dtest.env.db.user=root
-Dtest.env.db.pass=serial
```


**For Oracle**

Setup manually the user and the database schema. Start with a clean setup, drop the user before create a clean new one.


```sql
drop user OLATTEST cascade;
```

Create the user.

```sql
create user OLATTEST identified by "olat00002" temporary tablespace temp default tablespace users;
grant connect to OLATTEST;
grant all privileges to OLATTEST;
```

Setup the schema with setupDatabase.sql for Oracle and run the tests:

```bash
mvn clean test -Dwith-oracle -Dtest.env.db.oracle.pass=olat00002 -Dtest=org.olat.test.AllTestsJunit4 -Ptomcat
```

#### Problems with JUnit tests
Don't forget to update the test database schema whenever something changes. The DB-alter files are not automatically applied to the test database. 

If you encounter strange failures, it is recommended to drop the database and re-initialize it from scratch. This is also the recommended behavior 
when the test get slower over time. 


#### Execute Selenium functional tests

The Selenium integration tests start the whole web application in Tomcat 9.0. They run with
Google Chrome or Firefox and their WebDrivers will be automatically downloaded (internet connection
needed). The browsers need to be installed the standard way on Mac or Linux.

Execution time ca. 60 - 90m

**For PostgreSQL:**

```bash
mvn clean verify -DskipTests=true -Dwith-postgresql -Dtest.env.webdriver.browser=chrome -Dtest.env.webdriver.browserVersion=102.0.5005.61 -Dtest.env.webdriver.chrome.version=102.0.5005.61 -Dtest.env.db.postgresql.pass=serial -Ptomcat
```

Or with Firefox

```bash
mvn clean verify -DskipTests=true -Dwith-postgresql -Dtest.env.webdriver.browser=firefox -Dtest.env.webdriver.browserVersion= -Dtest.env.db.postgresql.pass=serial -Ptomcat
```

**For MySQL:**

```bash
mvn clean verify -DskipTests=true -Dwith-mysql -Ptomcat
```


#### Execute a single Selenium functional integration test in Eclipse

First build the application without tests as before

```bash
mvn clean verify -DskipTests=true -DskipSeleniumTests=true -Ptomcat
```

Run single test as JUnit Test in Eclipse
