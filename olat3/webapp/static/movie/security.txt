The OLAT movie viewer has a build in simple security. The user can embed a movie with the
<hollywood[s].unizh.ch> url as streaming server. With the hollywoods, a hardcoded token gets
inserted into the final url by the viewer.mov which embeds itself the final movie in a reference movie.
With this mechanism you can "protect" movies to be watched by everyone that has the url.

example: 

	from: rtsp://hollywoods.unizh.ch/meinmovie.mov
	to rtsp://hollywood.unizh.ch/secureToken/meinmovie.mov
