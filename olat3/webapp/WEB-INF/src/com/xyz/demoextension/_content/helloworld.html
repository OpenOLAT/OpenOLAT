## In velocity, just use plain HTML. All commands are prepended by 
## a hash sign, references to object are denoted by a dollar sign.

<h3>Hello everybody</h3>
<p>This is a <b>$myContentVariable</b> example.</p>


## This is a reference to the VelocityRenderDecorator which exposes
## some useful methods to the velocity container such as 
## building links or instructions to render a sub-component...

## We'd like a link which triggers an event which will be dispatched by our
## HelloWorldController. The command is "sayhello" and the link will
## be displayd with text translated by the translator passed to the VelocityContainer
## and the key "sayhello_i18n_key" automatically.

<div>This is the way to create a component link.</br>
<p>$r.render("say.hello")</p>
</div>

## image example (resource from "webapp/static/images/..."). For pictures already available in OLAT.
<div>
<img border="0" src="$r.staticLink("images/olat/powered_by_uzh.png")" alt="University of Zurich" width="120" height="30">
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
## image button example
<div>$r.render("say.hello.xsmall")</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>$r.render("say.hello.small")</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>$r.render("say.hello")</div>
