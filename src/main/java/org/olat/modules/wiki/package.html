<h3>Overview of the GUI part of the integrated wiki engine</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The modules wiki package contains the code for creating, editing,
viewing and persisting a wiki. Wiki's are repository entries or
collaboration tools entries when used in a private learngroup
environnement. The persistence is done through the filesystem. You will find the files of a wiki in one of the following
locations

<ul>
	<li>olatdata/bcroot/repository</li>
	<li>olatdata/bcroot/cts/wikis</li>
</ul>

<p>By opening on of the locations you will find the following strcture:


<ul>
	<li>media: Contains the media files like images, pdf's used in this
	wiki. Each file has it's own metadata file xyz.metadata</li>
	<li>versions: Contains the version history of an wiki article, each
	time a change is saved a version file gets created</li>
	<li>wiki: Contains the recent wiki articles and for each article also a
	java properties file containing metadata</li>
</ul>
The filenames are somehow cryptic. They are generated by converting the
wiki article name into an base64 string and removing the "/" which is
also an element of the base64 encoding. This makes it save for a
filesystem even if an article name contains special characters or utf-8
chars. By enabling the debug mode for the wiki class (see administration
tab in the browser) you can see the mapping of a wikiword to an base64
id by clicking the "a-z" link inside the wiki.
