				User manager configuration
				Users from the system group 'userManager' can be configured to have the following 
				rights within the user management. Currently the rights are applied to all members
				of the user management. Individual rights on a per user base are not possible. The
				configuration below does not apply to system administrators, those always have full
				access to the user management. 
				- canCreateUser: Allows the user to create new system users. The users are automatically
				  put into the system group users.
				- canDeleteUser: Allows the user to delete users. 
				- canCreatePassword: Allows the user to create new OLAT passwords when no such password
				  exists. If set to false, the usermanager has a limited user creation form that has no 
				  option to add a password. In addition, the user import workflow does not feature
				  a password column.
				- canModifyPassword: Allows the user to modify the password of all users that he has 
				  the right to manage (see canManageXXX configuration below)
				- canStartGroups: Allows the user to start every group a user is in. If disabled, the groups
				  are only listed and have no link to start.
				- accessToQuota: Allows the user to modify the personal quota of users he can manage
				- accessToProperties: Allows the user to see all properties of for users he can manage
				  including the course properties. This is usually not very interresting for user 
				  managers, it is commonly used by system administrators for debugging.
				- accessToPolicies: Allows the user to see system security policies for all users he
				  can manage. This is usually not very interresting for user managers.
				- accessToAuthentications: Allows the user to see and delete authentication tokens for
				  user he can manage. This is used e.g. to reset the RSS or Jabber password or to remove
				  a shibboleth or OLAT authentication. In most cases this is a power feature used only
				  by system administrators.
				- canManageGroupmanagers: Allows the user to add a user to the system group 
				  groupmanagers. Groupmanagers can manage course comprehensive groups using the top
				  navigation site Groupmanagement. When set to false, the user manager is not allowed 
				  to modify any profile information or password from a user that is within such a group.
				- canManageAuthors: Allows the user to add a user to the system group authors. Authors
				  are allowed to create new learning resources in the learning resources repository. Note
				  that beeing added as a co-author to a learning resource grants also the right to create
				  new learning resources, however the user is not automatically put into the system group
				  authors! When set to false, the user manager is not allowed to modify any profile 
				  information or password from a user that is within such a group.
				- canManageGuests: Allows the user to add a user to the system group guests. Guests are
				  anonymous users that must not be in any other system group. Guests have limited access
				  to OLAT. When set to false, the user manager is not allowed to modify any profile 
				  information or password from a user that is within such a group. Usually it is a good 
				  idea to let only system administrators manage guests.
				- canBypassEmailverification: True allows a user admin to bypass the email verification workflow, 
				  i.e. change emails directly without having a user to do verification.
				- canEditAllProfileFields: True allowes the user admin to edit all fields in user
				  profile form. Be careful when enabling this feature since the user admin will be able
				  to change fields which contain validated data from shibboleth login process.

   	A "Cron-Expression" is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. The 6 mandatory and 1 optional fields are as follows:
	Field Name 	  	Allowed Values 	  	Allowed Special Characters

	As of OLAT 6.3 it's best to let the cronjob run every two hours since users can now choose how often 
	they will get notified. The shortest interval is set to two hours.
