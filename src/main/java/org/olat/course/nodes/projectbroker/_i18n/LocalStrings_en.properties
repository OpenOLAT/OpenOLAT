Via "$\:change.project.state.not_assign.button" you can open a $\:chelp.projectbroker.themaSg anew--even if there are participants that are registered and accepted already. Please keep in mind that the last two buttons will only be visible if the course author has provided the $\:chelp.projectbroker.themenboerse with the option to accept participants manually.
chelp.projectbroker.descriptionProjectCustomFields=There are so-called "$\:form.options.customfield.legend" course authors can define. Course authors determine if topic authors should select a value from a pull-down list or if they are to indicate a value of their own.

If the $\:detailsform.state.label is set to "$\:state_assigned" no more users will be able to register. If you have already selected a $\:chelp.projectbroker.themaSg its $\:detailsform.state.label is either "$\:state_prov_enrolled" (a topic author has to accept you first as participant) or it is "$\:state_enrolled" (automatic registration). As soon as a topic author accepts your registration your $\:detailsform.state.label will be set to "$\:state_final_enrolled".
chelp.projectbroker.descriptionProjectStateLabelProjectManager=If you are a topic or course author and there are no registered participants for your $\:chelp.projectbroker.themaSg your $\:detailsform.state.label is set to show "$\:state_not_assigned.accountmanager.no.candidate".

In the $\:form.modules.dropbox participants will be able to upload files. Topic authors can store files in a $\:form.modules.returnbox . If there are no modifications all partial elements will be enabled. When deselecting the $\:form.modules.dropbox its tab will be dimmed and no longer accessible.
chelp.projectbroker.editProjectAttachmentfilename=Within the field $\:detailsform.attachmentfilename.label you can upload files. If you want to upload several files you should zip them first before uploading that single ZIP file.
chelp.projectbroker.editProjectCustomFields=Within the so-called "$\:chelp.projectbroker-optionsCustomfields.title" you can either indicate some free text or choose a value from a list. This depends on the course author's settings.
chelp.projectbroker.editProjectDescription=In the field $\:detailsform.description.label you can describe your $\:chelp.projectbroker.themaSg in detail.
chelp.projectbroker.editProjectDetailsformMailNnotification=When choosing this option you will get an e-mail notification in case a course participant selects or deselects your $\:chelp.projectbroker.themaSg

chelp.projectbroker.editProjectPlacesLabel=That way you can limit the number of available vacancies.
chelp.projectbroker.editProjectResponsible=When creating a $\:chelp.projectbroker.themaSg you will automatically be the person responsible for this topic. However, you can put others in charge of that role in the tab $\:tab.project.members or appoint other users to persons responsible for your topic.
chelp.projectbroker.editProjectStateLabelGeneral=The person responsible for a topic can modify the $\:detailsform.state.label . Just save and select "$\:change.project.state.assign.button" or "$\:change.project.state.not_assign.button".
chelp.projectbroker.editProjectStateLabelParticipant=In this field you will see the $\:detailsform.state.label . If the $\:detailsform.state.label is "$\:state_not_assigned" users will be able to sign in for a $\:chelp.projectbroker.themaSg as long as the maximum of vacancies is not exceeded. If the $\:detailsform.state.label is "$\:state_assigned" no more users will be able to sign in. If you have already choosen a $\:chelp.projectbroker.themaSg its $\:detailsform.state.label will be either "$\:state_prov_enrolled" in case the person in charge has to accept you as participant or it is "$\:state_enrolled" in case the registration procedure is automatic.
chelp.projectbroker.editProjectStateLabelProjectManager=If you are the person responsible for a topic or a course author and if there are no participants registered for your $\:chelp.projectbroker.themaSg yet the $\:detailsform.state.label will be "$\:state_not_assigned.accountmanager.no.candidate".
