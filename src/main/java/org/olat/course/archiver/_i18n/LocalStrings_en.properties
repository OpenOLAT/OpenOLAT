chelp.log1=Users with the right to archive (usually course administrators) can save a ZIP file (e.g. $\:chelp.logZip) in their personal folder (<i>$org.olat.home\:menu.bc</i> -> <i>private</i> -> <i>archive</i>) along with those log files\:
chelp.log2=This ZIP file contains the files $\:chelp.logStat und $\:chelp.logAdm .
chelp.log3=If your OLAT authority is set accordingly it will additionally contain the file $\:chelp.logUser to be dealt with elsewhere.
chelp.log4=Please note that in the file $\:chelp.logStat course participants are anonymized as follows\:
chelp.log5=Each course participant receives a number (e.g. *7FFBA8C371B1A3DACCF5F12227A75CE82D6C4CE6) generated at random; this number remains unchanged within a course.
