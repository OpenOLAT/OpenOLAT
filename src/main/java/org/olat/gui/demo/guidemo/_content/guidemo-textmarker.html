<h3>Text Marker demo</h3>
Hello everybody, this is just some demo text in OpenOlat to show the really cool stuff you can do using the text marker wrapper controller. 
<p>
The really cool thing is that you can use the same for marking some text as also for showing glossar or hints or something. Just check it out!
<p>
The only thing you have to do to use this is wrapping your component with the TextMarkerContainerController and add a file containing the markings or some manual entires.
